    <h1 id="functor-and-monad-in-swift">Functor and Monad in Swift</h1>
<p>I have been trying to teach myself Functional Programming since late 2013. Many of the concepts are very daunting because of their somewhat academic nature.</p>
<p>Since I&#39;m obviously not an expert, I intend this to be a very practical post. You will find many posts trying to explain what a Monad is, <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/burritos.html">some of them trying a bit too hard to come up with similes</a>, but hopefully the sample code here will illustrate some of the concepts better.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t until recently that I finally could say that I <em>got</em> what Monad means. Let&#39;s explore why this concept even exists, and how it can help you when writing Swift code.</p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>One of the first things that we got to see at the 2014 WWDC with the introduction of Swift was that we could use the <code>map</code> function with the collection types. Let&#39;s focus on Swift&#39;s <code>Array</code>.</p>
