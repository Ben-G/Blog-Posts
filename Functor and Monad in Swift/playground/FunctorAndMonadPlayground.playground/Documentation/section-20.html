<p>We&#39;ve seen what <code>map</code> can do when implemented on a container type, like <code>Optional</code>, <code>Array</code> or <code>Result</code>. To recap, it allows us to get a new container, where the value(s) wrapped inside are transformed according to a function.
So <strong>what&#39;s a Functor</strong> you may ask? A Functor is any type that implements <code>map</code>. That&#39;s the whole story.</p>
<p>Once you know what a functor is, we can talk about some types like <code>Dictionary</code> or even closures, and by saying that they&#39;re functors, you will immediately know of something you can do with them.</p>

<p>In the earlier example, we used the transformation function to return another <em>value</em>, but what if we wanted to use it to return a new <code>Result</code> object? Put another way, what if the transformation operation that we&#39;re passing to <code>map</code> can fail with an error as well? Let&#39;s look at what the types would look like.</p>
